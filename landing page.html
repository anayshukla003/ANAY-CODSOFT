<li>Reinforce your brand: You’ve already put in the work to build a digital brand, so use what you’ve learned. This is the result of maintaining consistency in your website’s appearance, tone, style, and copy. Having a clear and strong brand has several benefits. When your users don’t convert immediately, a strong brand identity can help them remember you in the future, respond to your remarketing efforts, or recommend you to their friends.</li><br>
<li>Generate leads: Both types of landing pages can generate leads for your business and increase sales. Landing pages are more targeted, allowing them to focus on conversion rates rather than education and information. Instead, you can highlight the features of your products and services and sell more to a targeted audience that’s already interested in your offerings.</li><br>
<li>Increase traffic: Even if lead generation isn’t your main goal, you can still increase website traffic with a landing page, increasing brand awareness and allowing potential customers to learn more about your business. When your landing pages are optimized for SEO, they can further target organic traffic to increase the potential for conversions.</li>
